Jobshare is a job search website for people who are not CV condfident. I will be adding more to the page throughout the course.

I have used Bootstrap 4.4.1 for the front-end stylying.
As of now, the like and dilike buttons are noty limted per user. I will add a trait table later on to limit each user to one like/dislike on each post.
